We embark on the exciting journey of defining the smallest possible geohash that encompasses an entire given geospatial dataset. This could be a collection of points, a network of lines, or a set of polygons - no matter the data type, we're targeting the same goal: full coverage with minimum geohash size. With the information provided in this repository, we aim to empower everyone with the understanding and tools (Python Scripts) necessary to optimally bound any given geospatial data with smallest geohashes.
